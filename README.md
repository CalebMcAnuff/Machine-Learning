# AAPL Stock Data Analysis and Prediction  
## Introduction  
Welcome to the AAPL Stock Data Analysis and Prediction project! This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates a detailed analysis of Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock data using Python. Our approach includes data acquisition, visualization, and the application of various machine learning models to predict stock price movements.

## Project Overview  
The objective of this project is to utilize historical AAPL stock data to understand its price dynamics and to predict future stock movements. We employ various Python libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning to achieve insightful analysis and predictive modeling.

## Technologies Used  
Python: Primary programming language for analysis and modeling.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib & mplfinance: For data visualization including line and candlestick charts.
Scikit-learn: For implementing machine learning models.
Alpaca API: For fetching historical stock data.
Features of the Notebook
Data Retrieval: Fetches historical data of AAPL stock using the Alpaca API.
Data Visualization: Includes line charts and candlestick charts to visualize stock prices.
Feature Engineering: Incorporates lag features to capture the time-dependent nature of stock prices.
Predictive Modeling: Uses Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) to predict stock price movements.
Model Evaluation: Evaluates models using metrics like MSE, MAE, and accuracy score.
